## Overview

This project is a gallery app, a social media platform that allows users to share, rate, and comment on photos. It was developed as part of a class project at Zespół Szkół Ponadgimnazjalnych Nr 10 w Łodzi in 2021. This was my first larger project, and it served as a great learning experience in web development.

## User functionality:
- Register and Login: Users can create an account and log in to access the platform. 
- Create Albums: Users can organize their photos into albums. 
- Add Photos: Users can upload and add photos to their albums. 
- Rate and Comment: Users can interact with other users' photos by rating and commenting on them.
## Admin functionality:
- Content Moderation: Admins can approve or reject the creation of albums, photos, and comments.
- User Management: Admins can activate or deactivate user accounts.
- Permission Control: Admins can modify user permissions to grant or restrict access to certain features.
